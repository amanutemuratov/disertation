    Master's Dissertation of Pernekhan Utemuratov explores several techniques and methods of recognition and broadcasting whiteboard content. It is a good contribution for an E-Learning industry.
    
    Dissertation introduces a new approaches for identification of whiteboard area with using training algorithms and image processing methods. Also comparisons between different image processing, edge detection algorithms are provided with clear results. 
    
    In addition I wish to say that it is a very solid work. Results from the research could be used as a solution for online education platforms. The dissertation is a good starting point for many further researches on an effective broadcasting of the region of interest with a specific characteristics. Moreover, figures of results of applied algorithms and implementation details could be used as a hint for quickly understanding the research analysis.
    
    I strongly recommend to evaluate the dissertation of Pernekhan Utemuratov as ``excellent'' and award him with a deserved qualification ``MSc in Information Systems'' by specialty 6M070300.
